# AI Humanities
## A Program for the Wheaton Institute for the Interdisciplinary Humanities (WIIH)

Artificial intelligence has become popular and is accessible like never before. In the 70 years since its original conception in the 1956 seminal workshop at Dartmouth College, AI for most people remained hardly more than a science fiction idea. But now, everybody can try it out with a growing variety of products and services offering image generation, natural language processing, or assisted driving. People are experiencing the technology mostly in a playful, not at all engineering or science driven way: Writing prompts to generate mostly silly and often funny images, letting a large language model write poems or short texts, trying to outsmart teachers by submitting AI generated papers. Generative writing, creating images, editing videos, or composing music have become the focus of the tech industry, attracting tens of billions of dollars in investments. These are not the topics of engineering. These are the topics of the humanities. And the humanities are not just delivering and shaping the applications. The critical self-reflectivity that is defining for all the humanities delivers the foundation to understand the new technology, to make sense of it, and to define its ethical boundaries independent of the pragmatics of engineering and business.

A vivid and critical discussion about the immediate ethical problems that AI poses on society and on individuals has already been going on for at least a decade in academia, policy circles, and more and more in mainstream media. The range of issues is wide: Data bias and discrimination, violation of informational self-determination and privacy, undermining of authorship, precarious labor, fake news, libel and defamation, creation of harmful images, and a general lack of accountability and reliability inherent in all machine learning technologies. The arguments of critiquing the all too naive techno-optimism deliver the foundation on which we can build a future with AI in a critically constructive way.

I propose to revisit and reclaim AI as an endeavor of the humanities, deeply philosophical, artistic and creative, a project for the liberal arts:

- How can we understand artificial intelligence as part of the liberal arts, and of the humanities in particular, and not just as another piece of technology?
- How does AI affect the humanities and how should AI be shaped by the humanities?
- What philosophy comes implicit or even explicit in AI? What philosophy can potentially be modeled with AI?
- How can higher education, liberal arts education in particular, make use of AI? What are risks?
- How does AI touch the life and experience of the students already now, and in the foreseeable future?
